    "# Measuring Personalization Performance Using Amplitude\n",
    "In this exercise you will explore the conversion performance of your Personalize deployment in Retail Demo Store using Amplitude's analytics platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Recommended Time: 30 minutes*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This module uses the Retail Demo Store's Recommendation service to run experiments across variations that depend on the personalization features of the Retail Demo Store, it is assumed that you have either completed the Personalization workshop or those resources have been pre-provisioned in your AWS environment. If you are unsure and attending an AWS managed event such as a workshop, check with your event lead.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project also assumes that Amplitude has been configured during the deployment of the Retail Demo Store in your AWS account or managed event account. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to deploy Amplitude, you will need access to an Amplitude workspace, and an Amplitude API key that allows you to send data to Amplitude.  We recommend setting up a separate Amplitude project for the workshop, so that you can delete the demo data that will be passed to Amplitude as part of the workshop when you are finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying personalizaiton can be challenging in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deciding where to deploy personalized experiences is often done using best guesses\n",
    "2. Measuring the conversion outcomes of personalized experiences once they are deployed can be difficult without proper tooling\n",
    "\n",
    "Amplitude addresses these issues by providing a comprehensive real-time measurement platform that allows you to track user behavior in the form of real-time events before and after the deployment of Personalize. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, you will set up tracking for Amplitude events, analyze user behavior prior to peronalization being deployed, and then measure the effects of personalization on user behavior after Personalize is deployed in the Retail Demo Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set Up Amplitude\n",
    "\n",
    "Amplitude works by collecting real-time data from user behavior in the Retail Demo Store website.  The Amplitude tracking code is included in the workshop for you, so user interactions with the application will be collected in Amplitude if you included your Amplitude API key during the deployment of the Retail Demo Store environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the Retail Demo Store is developed using the Vue framework, we can load Amplitude when the user loads a page by including the Amplitude tracking script using an import statement in `../src/web-ui/src/analytics/AnalyticsHandler.js`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "/* \n",
    " * Centralized handling of all analytics calls for Pinpoint, Personalize \n",
    " * (event tracker), and partner integrations.\n",
    " */\n",
    "import Vue from 'vue';\n",
    "import { Analytics as AmplifyAnalytics } from '@aws-amplify/analytics';\n",
    "import Amplitude from 'amplitude-js'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the tracking script is loaded into a page, it can be used to fire events in response to user actions.  As an example, when a user clicks on a product on one of the Retail Demo Store pages, a ProductViewed event will be sent to Amplitude, using this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if (this.amplitudeEnabled()) {\n",
    "    // Amplitude event\n",
    "    var eventProperties = {\n",
    "        productId: product.id,\n",
    "        name: product.name,\n",
    "        category: product.category,\n",
    "        image: product.image,\n",
    "        feature: feature,\n",
    "        experimentCorrelationId: experimentCorrelationId,\n",
    "        price: +product.price.toFixed(2)\n",
    "    };\n",
    "    Amplitude.getInstance().logEvent('ProductViewed', eventProperties);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These events are the same as events that are used to train the Personalize models used to offer users Personalize recommendations.  This is important since you will want the reports in Amplitude's analytics platform to reflect the same information that is being used to create Personalize models.  This will give you the most accurate way to measure user behavior before Personalize is deployed, and a consistent way to measure user behavior after Personalize is deployed in the Retail Demo Store site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retail Demo Store sends the following events to Personalize and Amplitude:\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: Add markdown for table of events from blog post here\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measuring Conversion Before Personalization is Deployed\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Amplitude reports rely on real user data, you will be using a data simulator to create enough events for you to be able to run a useful report in Amplitude.  The data simulator included in the Retail Demo Store will send the events shown above as though they were being generated by real users of the Retail Demo Store.  This will simulate common browsing behaviors at a sufficent volume to allow you to run a report that looks like one that might be used in your own production applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first simulated set of data will represent the Retail Demo Store prior to the deployment of the three personalization features you deployed in the first workshop exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the code below to add in your Amplitude API key, and then run the code to send events to your Amplitude instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: Modify configs below to accept a write key directly from the code rather than a config file\n"
