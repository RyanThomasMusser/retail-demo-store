    "# Retail Demo Store Messaging Workshop - Braze\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop we will use [Braze](https://braze.com/) to add the ability to personalize marketing messages to customers of the Retail Demo Store using customer behavioral data and the Personalize models you trained in the prior workshops. We are going to define a campaign in Braze to send target users an email with product recommendations from the Amazon Personalize campaign we created in the Personalization workshop earlier.  You will also create an email template using the Braze Connected Content feature.  When the campaign is launched, Connected Content will send emails to the users that belong in the target group.  These emails will be formatted using the Personalize Campaign you created earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended Time: 1 hour\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this module uses Amazon Personalize to generate and associate personalized product recommendations for users, it is assumed that you have either completed the [Personalization](../1-Personalization/1.1-Personalize.ipynb) workshop or those resources have been pre-provisioned in your AWS environment. If you are unsure and attending an AWS managed event such as a workshop, check with your event lead.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the workshop will also require access to a Braze account.  If you are unsure of how to set that up conact <TODO: INSERT CONTACT HERE>."

    "### Data Collection via AWS Amplify\n",
    "\n",
    "The Retail Demo Store's Web UI leverages [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) to integrate with AWS services for authentication ([Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/)), messaging and analytics ([Amazon Pinpoint](https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)), and to keep our personalization ML models up to date ([Amazon Personalize](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/)). AWS Amplify provides libraries for JavaScript, iOS, Andriod, and React Native for building web and mobile applications. For this workshop, we'll be focusing on how user information and events from the Retail Demo Store's Web UI are sent to Pinpoint. This is depicted as **(1)** and **(2)** in the architecture above. We'll also show how the user information and events synchronized to Pinpoint are used to create and send personalized messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new user signs up for a Retail Demo Store account, views a product, adds a product to their cart, completes an order, and so on, the relevant function is called in `AnalyticsHandler.js` in the Retail Demo Store Web UI. The new user sign up event triggers a call to the `AnalyticsHandler.identify` function where user information from Cognito is used to [update an endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/apireference/apps-application-id-endpoints.html) in Pinpoint. In Pinpoint, an endpoint represents a destination that you can send messages to, such as a mobile device, email address, or phone number.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before you can run a campaign in Braze, you will need to create an email template that uses Braze Connected Content to fetch Product recommendations for the users you will be emailing via the campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Log in to the Braze [console](https://dashboard.braze.com/auth).  You will need to have a Braze account configured for you to continue this workshop, or use your existing Braze account.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Braze Login Screen](images/braze-create-template-0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. On the left hand pane of the Braze console, click the Templates & Media link.  This will show the Templates list screen.  Click the From File button under Basic Email Templates at the top of the screen.\n",
