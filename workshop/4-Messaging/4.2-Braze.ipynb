    "# Retail Demo Store Messaging Workshop - Braze\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop we will use [Braze](https://braze.com/) to add the ability to personalize marketing messages to customers of the Retail Demo Store using customer behavioral data and the Personalize models you trained in the prior workshops. We are going to define a campaign in Braze to send target users an email with product recommendations from the Amazon Personalize campaign we created in the Personalization workshop earlier.  You will also create an email template using the Braze Connected Content feature.  When the campaign is launched, Connected Content will send emails to the users that belong in the target group.  These emails will be formatted using the Personalize Campaign you created earlier.\n",

    "Recommended Time: 1 hour\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This module uses Amazon Personalize to generate and associate personalized product recommendations for users.  The content of this workshop is presented with the assumption that you have either completed the [Personalization](../1-Personalization/1.1-Personalize.ipynb) workshop or those resources have been pre-provisioned in your AWS environment. If you are unsure and attending an AWS managed event such as a workshop, check with your event lead.\n",

    "Braze will send emails to your users based on their behavior or based on attributes of their user profiles.  A discussion of Braze campaigns is beyond the scope of this document but Braze will ingest real-time events from mobile and web applications.  This data can be used to identify users and to build user profiles that can be used to determine when to message or email users.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This event data flow will happen in parallel to the same behavioral event data being sent to Amazon Personalize. In this workshop, the demo store uses Amplify to send events to Personalize as shown in the diagram. This data is used to train a recommendations model that can in turn be used by Braze Connected Content to personalize content to users of your mobile and web applications when your Braze campaign runs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Braze Connected content will be able to get these recommendations via a recommendation service running in AWS.  Earlier in this workshop, this service was deployed using by the Cloud Formation templates you used to deploy the workshop environment in ECS."
